# I just made a .py file for us to use. My thinking is that we'll just map the lines in the readme directly over to this .py file
# to work on merging/commiting/pull requesting whatever else we want to do or work on. 
# I'm really just taking up space now since the stuff we're looking
# at starts on line 6........ =D Cheers! 
# Let me know if y'all have any ideas! I'm sure there're a lot better ways to do all of this!!
